Stone placeholder image will be here.

Since I cannot create actual image files, please create a simple placeholder image:

1. Create a 200x200 PNG file
2. Fill it with a stone texture or gray color (#8B8B8B)
3. Add text "Stone" in the center
4. Save it as: src/main/resources/images/stone_placeholder.png

OR use this temporary solution:
- Download a free stone texture image from:
  https://via.placeholder.com/200x200/8B8B8B/FFFFFF?text=Stone
  
- Save it to: src/main/resources/images/stone_placeholder.png

The application will look for this image at runtime.
